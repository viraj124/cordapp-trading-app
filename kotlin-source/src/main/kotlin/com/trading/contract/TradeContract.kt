 * This contract enforces rules regarding the creation of a valid [TradeState].

 * For a new [Trade] to be created onto the ledger, a transaction is required which takes:
 * - Zero input states.
 * - One output state: the new [Trade].
 * - An Create() command with the public keys of both the party.
 *
 *  For a counter [Trade] to be created onto the ledger, a transaction is required which takes:
 * - One input states: the old [Trade].
 * - One output state: the new [Trade].
 * - An CounterTrade() command with the public keys of both the lender and the borrower.
 *
 * All contracts must sub-class the [Contract] interface.
